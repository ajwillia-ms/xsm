need to insert a script to generate an initial site configuration, as it involves
MD5 hashes of passwords.

If you know your chosen MD5 you can try to hack...

you need

  site.xml
  connection.xml
  members/user1.xml (where user1 is your 1st username)

examples:

site.xml:

  <xsmsite admin="admin" newsSource="/News">
    <title>Site title</title>
    <description /><keywords />
    <stylesheet>default</stylesheet>
    <layout>default</layout>
    <pages default="/Home">
    </pages>
  </xsmsite>
  
clearly this will require "Home" and "News" pages, but they can be created inside
the interface

connection.xml:
  <xsmconnection type="local">
    <rootDir>/var/www/localhost/htdocs</rootDir>
    <rootUrl>http://example.com</rootUrl>
    <prefixUrl></prefixUrl>
  </xsmconnection>
  
other examples will be available soon

member/user1.xml

  <member>
    <fullname>Aname</fullname>
    <theme>blue</theme>
    <htmlEditor></htmlEditor>
    <email>anemail@example.com</email>
    <web></web>
    <pic></pic>
    <password>INSERT MD5</password>
  </member>

OK, that is all you need to start hacking - you can now log in as the new user
("user1") with the password that the MD5 belongs to, and the site name that the
directory specifies...
