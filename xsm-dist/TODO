This is a rough idea of what I want to get done, and in some cases, when too.
Check the bugs on http://dev.rectang.com/projects/xsm/query too.


1.1:

  features:
    add editing of admins and site editors to interface...
    email users on creation if the email address is filled in
    add "move to top" and "move to bottom" next to move up and down buttons

    admin:
      set the default page of a site (then save the page)
      set the news page of a site (then regen site)
      set the login page of a site (blank = old style login link) (then save the page)

other:

  features:

    add groups too! - need a groups page for site admin
    users can set their timezones?

    allow direct (external) links in menu

    allow users to specify that the textarea fields etc be non-proportional
    
    Gallery should somehow thumbnail videos? or allow custom thumbnails...

    add XSM admin pages - start with "upgrade" for re-deploying...

    add widgets choice[multiple/single/boolean]
    add a javadoc renderer - overriding the default docbook class?

    add calendar summary
    spell check for wysiwyg editor

    add layout taglibs
      xsm:stylesheet
      xsm:breadcrumbs
      site metadata too

    add other (internal) tags
      xsm:encodevalue    } these should unify the encoding needed on HTML forms
      xsm:encodetextarea }
 
housekeeping:

  fix handlers, uses props Map and see what else req is used for

  replace all text with locale lookups

  fix class names all over for more advanced stylesheet control

  remove extra mkdirs etc and optimise publishing backends
  replace e.printStackTraces with logging - read logs in site admin and XSM admin
