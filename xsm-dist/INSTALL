Requires:

  java
  maven
  tomcat (or similar)

If you got XSM from source you will need to compile the application WAR file, type

  mvn package

The xsm-web/target/xsm-web-{version}.war file should then be copied into your
servlet container (we recommend tomcat) as xsm.war.

on a default install you need to extract xsm_demo_config.zip into your /etc
directory and give your servlet container write permissions to the /etc/xsm
directory it creates. This creates a default site named "demo".

Edit xsm_local.properties and set the "xsm.url" property to the url used
to access your xsm installation. This should not be localhost:8080 if you want
to make your site publicly available.
This file can be used to override more XSM default settings.

For more information on configuration check the documentation at
http://rectang.com/Software/XSM/Installing_XSM/

You will also need to place id_rsa (ssh private key) if you wish to use ssh remote
publishing.

You should now start your servlet container and head to:
http://localhost:8080/xsm/ (your installation may be different)
and log in as the user "admin" password "admin" and site name "demo" to get
started.
